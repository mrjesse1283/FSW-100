            <h3>The Importance of Running </h3>
            <h6>March 15 2020</h6>
            <h5>Without exercise, your heart weakens. Over time this leads to a decrease in the functionality of the left ventricle. A predisposition to conditions like congestive heart failure can be the result. The most important thing for maintaining a strong heart muscle is to treat it like any other muscle: give it a regular workout.</h5>

            <h3>Date night</h3>
            <h6>February 14 2020</h6>
            <h5>When you date your husband or wife, you get to have new experiences by doing and seeing new things. You get to know each other better because you're seeing each other in a new light â€“ sometimes literally! Common activities lead to shared feelings. This increases the amount of shared memories you have together.</h5>
